# py04_AppForTypingSpeedTest

Homework for *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022*

A desktop application which can test user typing speed.

* I picked an article from wikipedia for the application. I may update to some word list I found on github if I have
  time.
* I didn't follow the flow chart I drew entirely :sweat_smile:, the check during typing is only for UI display. 
The "correct" and "incorrect" sets I drew in the chart was actually implemented at the end, when the time is up.
